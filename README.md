Chao, D. (2023) 50-minute tutor session.

	* Explained why I did not need to create a Dim for each object and instead reference certain columns in the body of the code as a range.
	* I had the "Yearly Change" column prepared to divide the "yearly change" number by another number, but I was not sure which number that was. Mr. Chao helped explain the logic as to why it should be divided by the "open" figure.
