Was, Joe. (2008, April 8). Using VBA to search over multiple sheets.  https://www.mrexcel.com/board/threads/using-vba-to-search-over-multiple-sheets.333974/
	* Article referenced on how to use VBA code to include multiple worksheets.


Chao, D. (2023) 50-minute tutor session. 
	* Helped me restructure lines of my code into different sections.
	* Explained why I did not need to create a Dim for each object and instead reference certain columns in the body of the code as a range.
	* I had the "Yearly Change" column prepared to divide the "yearly change" number by another number, but I was not sure which number that was. Mr. Chao helped explain the logic as to why it should be divided by the "open" figure.
